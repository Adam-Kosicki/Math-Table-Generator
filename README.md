# Math-Table-Generator-
a command-line utility written in C that generates multiplication tables for a specified range of numbers. It takes two integer arguments representing the starting and ending numbers of the range. The program then calculates the multiplication tables for each number within the range and displays the results in a formatted manner, showing the process ID, the current number, and the product. The project demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using malloc to create an array to store the numbers in the specified range. It also showcases process handling and manipulation using the getpid function to retrieve the process ID. The utility provides an efficient way to generate and display multiplication tables within a given number range.
